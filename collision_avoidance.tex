\begin{abstract}
The ability to convey critical information promptly and efficiently between robots
swarms is critical in collision avoidance scenarios. Different approaches to data collection
are important considerations that must be taken in Real Time Systems where different “units” must
effectively coordinate spatial movement to prevent collisions. Through the use of the computer
networking concepts usch as the multicast protocol, our team has devised a new method for
data collection in order to meet the timing constraints of a dynamic system such as this. The multicast
concept allows for information management and establishment of policies related to a set of
subscribers to a particular multicast group, which receives messages from a spatial element who
manages and coordinates information and policies between the subscribed elements. The dynamics
of different multicast groups (of which a single subscriber can be a part of many) creates localized
information hubs and information that need not be distributed across entire networks. The resulting
hubs are flexible, sometimes redundant, localized environments that have better adaptability
to the immediate surroundings. Future studies and application of this networking concept can
provide legitimization of the algorithms presented here; for example, use of robots swarms in an
environment which is not homogeneous and where subscribers will obtain only relevant information
to a specific area of this environment.
